# Vocalization Recorder
Program for recording audiovisual data used for biological experiments related to supersonic vocalization. The program was written for the workshop that took place before the [3rd Ultrasonic Vocalization Conference](https://nencki.edu.pl/3rd-ultrasonic-vocalization-conference/) at Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology.

# Requirements
Program was written for Python 3.10.10. All the requirements were listed in the file _requirements.txt_. They can be installed using the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
It is recommended to create a virtual enviroment for this program. The program additionally requires the [librealsense SDK](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense) for connecting to the depth camera.
